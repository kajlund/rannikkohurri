    </div>
    <p>I’m Kaj Lund a.k.a LuKa, a partly self-taught programmer that has been employed
        developing business software since 1998.</p>

    <p>Over the years I’ve fiddled around with languages like Basic, Turbo Pascal, C++, Java,
        Delphi, C#, Python, Ruby and, as of lately, JavaScript.</p>

    <p>Back in 1999 we adopted a then pretty unique application framework/ORM called Bold for Delphi,
        and in doing so we adopted what is now known as Domain-Driven Design well before that term was
        invented by Eric Evans in 2004.</p>

    <p>If there is some general observation I’ve done over the years it is that we never seem to stop
        believing that there’s a silver bullet to be found for software development by using the latest
        language or framework. I don’t believe that there is such a silver bullet to be found, but I find
        it very rewarding to keep looking just to learn new technology.</p>

    <p>I consider myself being more of a Technology/Developer evangelist than a hard core programmer.</p>
